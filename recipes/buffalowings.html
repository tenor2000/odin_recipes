            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Coat with flour</strong>: Coat the chicken wings with a mixture of flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt. Refrigerate coated wings for at least an hour.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the sauce</strong>: In a saucepan on the stove, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic. Stir until butter is melted, then remove from heat and reserve for later.</li>
                <li><strong>Fry the wings: </strong>Fry the chicken wings in a skillet filled with oil heated to 375 degrees F. Remove the wings and place them on a paper-towel lined plate to remove the excess oil.</li>
